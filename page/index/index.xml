                <p>Preware is a homebrew package management application for your HP webOS device. Users can install any package from any of the open standard package feeds on preware.org (or any other location that hosts an open standard package feed).</p>
                <p>Preware is the most advanced installer currently available - it is the only on-device installer that can install applications, themes, and patches, as well as give access to over 1600 Linux programs.</p>

		   instructions that are included in that application.</p>
